## Collaboration with Teammates

To improve this task, I would stay in regular contact with my teammates and make sure we’re all on the same page. We could divide the work based on each person’s skills, and I’d frequently ask for feedback. Using version control and doing code reviews would help us stay organized and avoid duplicate work. I’d also recommend pair programming to solve tough problems more quickly.

## If I Had More Time
If I had more time, I’d focus on making the project better by exploring ways to improve the database, maybe moving from an in-memory solution to something more permanent. I’d also look into ways to automate things like deployment.
